* Emacs Twist for Nix
Emacs Twist is an alternative Emacs Lisp build machinery for Nix.
It can be used to build packages specified in your init file using Nix, in a pure and source-based way.

The goal of this project is to support the following two use cases:

- Let people manage their Emacs configurations using Nix in a reproducible, but much more configurable way than =emacsWithPackages= + =emacs-overlay=.
- Help with testing of Emacs Lisp packages that have difficult dependencies, such as dynamic libraries and Emacs Lisp packages that are not on any package registry.

At present, the former use case is almost supported.
It is currently being tested against real configurations to ensure feature parity.
The documentation will become available afterwards.
The latter is secondary, and I have not worked on it yet.
*Thus there may be breaking changes in the API.*
** Examples
I am preparing [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs-twist-examples][a repository of configuration examples]].
