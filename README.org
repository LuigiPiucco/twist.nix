* Emacs Twist for Nix
Emacs Twist is an Emacs Lisp build machinery for Nix.
It can be used to build packages specified in your init file using Nix, in a pure and source-based way.

The goal of this project is to support the following two use cases:

- Let people manage their Emacs configurations using Nix in a reproducible way.
- Help with testing of Emacs Lisp packages that have difficult dependencies, such as dynamic libraries and Emacs Lisp packages that are not on any package registry.

At present, the former use case is almost supported, and the documentation is in progress.
The latter is secondary, and I have not worked on it yet.
*Thus there may be breaking changes of the API.*
